# felixtjernberg.se

This project is currently in a state of disrepair because of dependencies, so links does not work correctly on the website :/

## What I learned from the project

I learned how to setup the application state in a way where it does not matter if the state is read from cookies or from search parameters

Which you can see in [this `+page.server.ts` file](https://github.com/felix-tjernberg/felixtjernberg.se/blob/main/src/routes/%5Bnavigation%5D/%2Bpage.server.ts)
